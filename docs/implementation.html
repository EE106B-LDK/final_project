              <p>
                For our object set, we chose objects E1 and F1 from the Evolved Grasping Analysis Dataset (EGAD) evaluation set. 
                We choose these two object because they we low in complexity while high in grasp diffculty. 
                Shape complexity is calculated as the entropy of the probability density function of the angular deficit of each vertex. 
                Grasp difficulty is measured by the 75th percentile grasp quality of the computed Ferrari-Canny quality metric for each object.

          <div class="column-container">
            <div class="column">
              <p>For our research subject, we chose the Robotiq 2F-85 to optimization on.
                We designed our own implementation for our own use using Fusion 360 and Robotiq's patent as a reference.
                We chose this gripper due to its parallel and encompassing capablities and its mechanical elegance. 
                Our gripper has a 85mm opening and is designed to install onto the Baxter arm. 
                It is actuated by a Towerpro MG996R Servo and controlled via serial commands from a host computer. 
                During testing, we validated that this gripper was capable of performing both parallel and
                encompassing grasps just like the Robotiq 2F-85. 
                This gripper is the baseline adaptive gripper that we compare all future optimizations to.

          <div class="column-container">
            <div class="column">
              <p> For our optimization method, we chose to use Differential Evolution to maximize the sum of some quality heuristic for all objects. 
                We chose to use gravity resistance as our heuristic, for its ease of implementation and computational simplicity. 
                For each set of candidate gripper parameters, we judge its quality by computing the gravity
                resistance metric for its best grasp on each object: </p>
              <p>Q(θ, o) = max<sub>φ</sub> gravityresistance(θ, φ, o) </p>
              <p>This is solved with a sample-based approach. Specifically,
                we sample 500 valid encompassing grasps, and return the
                one with the best score. To sample and score grasps for the
                adaptive gripper, we:
                <ol>
                <li><p>Select a random point on the object mesh and a random
                angle theta </p></li> 
                <li><p> Initialize an open adaptive gripper with its base’s center
                in contact with the selected point, and its orientation
                determined by theta and the face normal at that point </li> 
                <li><p> Close the gripper around the mesh by iteratively increas
                ing joint angles and checking for contact with the mesh
                and self-collisions </p></li> 
                <li><p> Using the discovered contact points (excluding contact
                points with the base of the gripper) to compute gravity
                resistance </p></li>

        <div class="column-container">
          <div class="column">
            <p>There were two surprising results from the comparison of
              metrics. The first was that optimization only improved the
              gravity metric marginally. The second was that for some of
              the difficult to grasp objects, there were only minor differences
              between the parallel jaw gripper and the adaptive gripper. This
              forces us to reconsider the benefits of an additional grasping
              mode, or to consider whether the gravity metric is an effective
              cost function for the optimization process.
              Table 1 summarizes our results. To compensate for the high
              variance in the results we observed, the table shows both the
              best result and the average of the top 5 results for each difficult
              to grasp object.</p>

            <p> We also evaluated the optimization output in a qualitative
              manner, by creating 3D CAD models of an adaptive grip-
              per based on the optimization output. Using these results,
              we discovered that the gripper model used for optimization
              was flawed and overly simplistic. The optimized parameters
              resulted in gripper geometries that are highly specialized for
              specific encompassing grasps and would be incapable of most
              parallel jaw grasps due to a design that prevents the jaws from
              ever touching. </p>
