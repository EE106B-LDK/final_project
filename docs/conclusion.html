            <h2>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</h2>
            <p>
                As seen in our results, we have successfully generated an optimized gripper for a set of objects.
                This can be seen when the adaptive gripper score decreases between the base and optimized gripper designs (lower score is better). 
                In addition, the pawn scores increases which shows that optimized gripper will perform wores on an object not in the set.

          <h2>Challenges Encoutered</h2>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)</b></li>
                <p> We initially wanted to able to simulate grasping in ROS Gaezebo.
                  However, this proved to be tricky because we needed to define our a URDF for the adaptive gripper.
                  We had successful defined a URDF for a simplied version of gripper using box primitives; but there were issues pairing it with the Baxter URDF.
                  To save ourselves from further trouble, we choose to not evaluate our gripper on simulation performance but on the same metric use to evolve the gripper.
                </p>
              <li><b>Picking up objects</b></li>
                <p> We had diffcultly picking up objects due to a lack of a proper URDF for the adaptive gripper and gripper model.
                  Since we had used a simplied model for our grasp policy and evolution algorithm, these gave faulty grasps for Baxter to execute on.
                  We decided to "fix" this problem by using measured offsets in simulation and have Baxter perform smaller motions to prevent major crashes.

          <h2>Things We Would Have Changed</h2>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Sampling</b> </li>
                <p> When we generate grasps in our grasp policy, we sample it randomly. 
                  This method is easy and simple but may not produce great results when evolving a new gripper or generating a new grasp.
                  We would have liked to have used a smarter sampling method that introduced less noise into the Differential Evolution algorithm (i.e. provide less variance).
                  This would let the alogrithm converge faster and produce higher scoring grippers and grasps.
                </p>
              <li><b>Joint Optimization</b> </li>
              <p> Another approach to solve the previous issue is to instead jointly optimizing the grasp within the Differential Evolution algorithm. 
                This would avoid the need to sample for grasps. However, it may reduce performance because it would increase the complexity of our input into the algorithm.
              </p>
              <li><b>Learned Metrics</b> </li>
                <p> Instead of using gravity resistance we could use learned metrics such as CNNs. 
                  These would produce more informed scores that would speed up Differential Evolution and give use better grasps overall.
                </p>
              <li><b>Kinematic Model for Gripper</b> </li>
                <p> Currently, we use a heavily simplfied model to represent our adaptive gripper. 
                  The benefits of a simple model is found in the speed of the Differential Evolution algorithm. 
                  However, this doesn't account for the real way the adaptie gripper would react to objects. 
                  Therefore, a kinematic model model is required to correctly model our gripper and to prevent infeasible collisions.

          <h2>Future Direction</h2>
          <ul> 
              <li><b>Extend to other gripper designs</b></li>
                <p> There types of grippers to explore which would expand our library of grippers. 
                  This would help us reach our original goal to generate any effective gripper for a given set of objects.
                </p>
              <li><b>Explore other grasp metrics and optimization/evolutionary algorithms</b> </li>
                <p> We have only tried Differental Evolution but there are many other algorithms that could be interesting to explore.
