        <p>Parallel jaw grippers are widely used in industry because of their low complexity, long lifetime, and ability to precisely manipulate objects. 
          As a result of this ubiquity, the scientific community uses parallel jaw grippers extensively in research, and over the past decades, developed various analytical and data-driven approaches to plan and evaluate grasps with the goal of improving manufacturing production lines and warehouse logistics operations.
          While significant progress has been made, autonomous grasp planning remains a complex topic with rich areas of research in both physical modeling of phenomena like contact friction, slip, compliance and object movementas well as overcoming uncertainty in sensing and actuation. </p>
          
        <p>In class, we implemented a basic grasp planning workflow, as shown in the figure 1, and saw that this process struggled with generating grasp plans that would successfully pick up an object. 
          One significant constraint was the fixed gripper geometry that had an arbitrarily selected maximum jaw size.

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p> We developed a design, evaluation and optimization process for complex grippers, and demonstrate the output of this process on adaptive grippers. 
          Adaptive grippers are underactuated grippers capable of parallel jaw grasping and encompassing grasps, and are good candidates for optimization because of clear design parameters that can be quickly evaluated.

            <h3> Applications </h3>
            <p>In manufacturing, the object to be grasped is often known beforehand, and grippers are custom-designed in order to maximize the chances of a successful grasp. 
              Automatic design of grippers would reduce the lead time and cost of developing high throughput manufacturing processes.</p>
